/// A testing macro for asserting that a message matches an expected type and parameters.
///
/// This macro is designed to simplify testing of message-based protocols where messages
/// are typically represented as enums with associated data. It performs two levels of
/// validation:
/// 1. Ensures the message is of the expected variant/type
/// 2. Validates that the message parameters match the expected values
///
/// If either check fails, the macro will panic with a descriptive error message,
/// making it ideal for use in unit tests and integration tests.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `$msg` - An expression that evaluates to the message to be tested
/// * `$message_type` - The path to the expected message variant (e.g., `Message::Connect`)
/// * `$expected_params` - The expected parameters/data associated with the message
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This macro will panic if:
/// - The message is not of the expected type/variant
/// - The message parameters don't match the expected values (using `assert_eq!`)
