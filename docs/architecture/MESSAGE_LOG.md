## Overview

The message log is a per-channel, segmented, append-only storage engine that
persists broadcast messages for channels with persistence enabled. It serves two
protocol operations introduced in PR #221:

- **`HISTORY`** — retrieve archived messages from a channel.
- **`CHAN_SEQ`** — query the available sequence range of a channel's log.

Each persistent channel maintains its own message log as a set of segment files
with companion sparse index files, stored in the channel's existing directory.

## Goals and Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Durable, ordered storage of broadcast payloads for persistent channels.
- Efficient seq-based lookups via sparse indexing.
- Zero-allocation read path (`EntryReader` with pre-allocated buffers, borrowed data in visitor).
- Crash-safe: detect and truncate partial writes on recovery.
- Simple eviction: delete entire segment files.

**Non-Goals:**
- Time-based retention (eviction is count-based via `max_persist_messages`).
- Cross-channel queries or global indexing.
- Replication or distributed log semantics.

## On-Disk Layout

### Directory Structure

Message log files share the channel directory established by `FileChannelStore`.
The directory is derived from a SHA-256 hash of the channel handler name:

```
<base_dir>/<sha256(handler)>/
  metadata.bin                        ← channel metadata (FileChannelStore)
  00000000000000000001.log            ← first segment (named by first seq, 20-digit zero-padded)
  00000000000000000001.idx            ← first segment's sparse index
  00000000000000000257.log            ← second segment
  00000000000000000257.idx            ← second segment's sparse index
  ...
```

A shared path utility computes `<sha256(handler)>` so both `FileChannelStore`
and `FileMessageLog` always agree on the directory.

### Segment Files

Segments are append-only binary files. A new segment is created when the active
segment exceeds the size threshold.

| Property         | Value              |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Max size         | 128 MiB            |
| Naming           | First seq, 20-digit zero-padded (e.g., `00000000000000000001.log`) |
| Roll trigger     | Checked **after** each append |
| Overshoot        | Up to one entry beyond 128 MiB (bounded by `max_payload_size`) |

### Log Entry Format

Each entry is a self-contained binary record:

```
┌─────────┬───────────┬──────────┬─────────────┬──────┬─────────┬────────┐
│ seq     │ timestamp │ from_len │ payload_len │ from │ payload │ crc32  │
│ 8 bytes │ 8 bytes   │ 2 bytes  │ 4 bytes     │ var  │ var     │ 4 bytes│
└─────────┴───────────┴──────────┴─────────────┴──────┴─────────┴────────┘
```

| Field         | Type   | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| `seq`         | `u64`  | Monotonically increasing sequence number |
| `timestamp`   | `u64`  | Unix timestamp at broadcast time |
| `from_len`    | `u16`  | Length of the `from` field in bytes |
| `payload_len` | `u32`  | Length of the `payload` field in bytes |
| `from`        | bytes  | Sender NID (e.g., `user@domain`) |
| `payload`     | bytes  | Message payload (raw bytes) |
| `crc32`       | `u32`  | CRC32 checksum over all preceding fields in the entry |

**Fixed overhead per entry: 26 bytes.**

**Omitted fields:**
- **`channel`** — implicit from the directory/file path.
- **`history_id`** — injected by the caller at read time, not a property of the stored message.

### Sparse Index Files

Each segment has a companion `.idx` file following the
[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) sparse index model, managed via
memory-mapped files (`mmap`) for efficient access.

| Property         | Value              |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Interval         | Every **4096 bytes** of log data written |
| Entry-0 rule     | An index entry is always written at offset 0 of each segment, regardless of the interval |
| Header           | None (Kafka-style) |
| CRC              | None (derived data; rebuilt from `.log` if corrupt) |

**Index entry format:**

```
┌────────────────┬───────────────┐
│ relative_seq   │ offset        │
│ 4 bytes (u32)  │ 8 bytes (u64) │
└────────────────┴───────────────┘
```

| Field          | Type  | Description |
|----------------|-------|-------------|
| `relative_seq` | `u32` | Seq number relative to the segment's base seq (from filename) |
| `offset`       | `u64` | Byte offset within the `.log` file |

**12 bytes per index entry.**

The first seq of a segment is derived from its filename. The last seq of a
sealed segment is determined by scanning the `.log` file with CRC validation
(populating `SegmentInfo.last_seq`). The active segment's last seq is tracked
in-memory and updated on each append.

#### Memory-Mapped Index Management (Kafka-style)

Index files are accessed via `mmap` (using the `memmap2` crate), mirroring how
Apache Kafka manages its offset indexes. There are two distinct modes depending
on whether the segment is active or sealed:

**Active segment — read-write `MmapMut`:**

When a new segment is created, its `.idx` file is **pre-allocated** to the
maximum capacity it could ever need, then memory-mapped read-write:

```
capacity = (segment_max_bytes / INDEX_INTERVAL_BYTES + 1) * INDEX_ENTRY_SIZE
```

For the default 128 MiB segments with 4096-byte index interval:
`(128 * 1024 * 1024 / 4096 + 1) * 12 ≈ 384 KB`.

The `+ 1` term accounts for the entry-0 rule above: every segment writes an
index entry at offset 0 regardless of the interval, so the upper bound on
entries is `(segment_max_bytes / INDEX_INTERVAL_BYTES) + 1`. Changing either
the formula or the entry-0 rule without updating the other can silently
overflow the pre-allocated capacity.

**Overshoot interaction.** Because the segment roll check fires *after* an
append (see [Segment Roll](#segment-roll)), a segment can grow up to one entry
beyond `SEGMENT_MAX_BYTES`. If that final overshooting append also crosses an
index interval boundary while the index is at peak utilization, the
implementation has no slot left to record it. The append path guards with
`pos + INDEX_ENTRY_SIZE <= mmap.len()` and silently drops the would-be index
entry — correctness is preserved (no out-of-bounds write, the segment rolls
on the next append), but the un-indexed tail of that segment will be reached
by a linear scan from the previous index entry. The scan distance is bounded
by `INDEX_INTERVAL_BYTES + max_entry_size`. Bumping the formula by one slot
would eliminate the silent skip; the trade-off is a few extra bytes of
pre-allocation per segment.

New index entries are written directly into the mmap at the current write
position (`active_idx_write_pos`). This avoids `write()` syscalls for index
updates — the kernel handles page dirtying and writeback. The active `.idx`
file handle is kept open and durability is enforced with async
`sync_all().await` on that file (instead of synchronous `mmap.flush()`), so
flush/roll do not block the shard runtime thread.

**Sealed segments — read-only `Mmap`:**

When a segment is rolled (finalized), the index lifecycle is:

1. `sync_all()` the active `.idx` file.
2. Drop the active `MmapMut`.
3. Truncate the `.idx` file from its pre-allocated size to the actual written
   size (`active_idx_write_pos` bytes).
4. Re-open and memory-map read-only (`Mmap`) for the now-sealed segment.

Sealed index mmaps remain mapped for the lifetime of the segment. They are
unmapped (dropped) before the segment files are deleted during eviction.

**Recovery:**

On startup, sealed segments get read-only mmaps. The active (last) segment's
index is extended back to its pre-allocated capacity and mapped read-write,
with `active_idx_write_pos` set to the actual (pre-extension) file size so
new entries continue from where the previous session left off.

**Binary search:**

Both `Mmap` (sealed) and `MmapMut` (active) are searched with the same
`index_lookup_in(&[u8], target_relative_seq)` function — a standard binary
search for the largest `relative_seq <= target`. For the active index, the
slice is bounded to `&mmap[..active_idx_write_pos]` to exclude the
zero-filled pre-allocated tail.

**Comparison with Kafka:**

| Aspect | Kafka | Narwhal |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Index file format | `relative_offset(4) + position(4)` = 8 bytes | `relative_seq(4) + offset(8)` = 12 bytes |
| Active index | Pre-allocated, `MmapMut` | Pre-allocated, `MmapMut` |
| Sealed index | Truncated to actual size, `Mmap` | Truncated to actual size, `Mmap` |
| Index interval | Configurable (`index.interval.bytes`, default 4096) | Hardcoded 4096 |
| Offset width | 4-byte relative (Kafka batches limit segment to 2 GB) | 8-byte absolute (simple, supports arbitrary segment sizes) |
| Warm-up | `mmap` + `madvise(WILLNEED)` | `mmap` (no explicit `madvise`) |

## Trait API

### MessageLog Trait

```rust
pub trait MessageLog: 'static {
    /// Append a message and its payload to the log.
    /// When message count exceeds `max_messages`, oldest segments are evicted.
    async fn append(
        &self,
        message: &Message,
        payload: &PoolBuffer,
        max_messages: u32,
    ) -> anyhow::Result<()>;

    /// Delete the entire log (all segments and index files).
    async fn delete(&self) -> anyhow::Result<()>;

    /// Flush buffered writes to durable storage (fsync).
    async fn flush(&self) -> anyhow::Result<()>;

    /// First retained sequence number, or 0 if the log is empty.
    /// In-memory value — cannot fail.
    fn first_seq(&self) -> u64;

    /// Last written sequence number, or 0 if the log is empty.
    /// In-memory value — cannot fail.
    fn last_seq(&self) -> u64;

    /// Read entries starting at `from_seq`, up to `limit` entries.
    /// Calls `visitor.visit()` for each entry. Returns the number of
    /// entries visited.
    ///
    /// Async because file reads use io_uring (compio). The visitor callback
    /// is also async, borrowing data from the EntryReader's buffers.
    ///
    /// **Bounds:**
    /// - `from_seq < first_seq()` is clamped to `first_seq()`; the read
    ///   begins at the oldest retained entry.
    /// - `from_seq > last_seq()` returns `Ok(0)` without invoking the
    ///   visitor.
    ///
    /// **Visitor errors:** if `visit()` returns `Err`, `read()` propagates
    /// the error and does **not** report a partial count. Entries already
    /// passed to the visitor before the failure are considered the
    /// visitor's responsibility (e.g., already-sent network frames).
    async fn read(
        &self,
        from_seq: u64,
        limit: u32,
        visitor: &mut impl LogVisitor,
    ) -> anyhow::Result<u32>;
}
```

**Key design decisions:**
- `first_seq()` and `last_seq()` return `u64` directly (not `Result`) because
  they are in-memory values updated on append/eviction. Sequence numbers
  start at 1; `0` is reserved as the empty-log sentinel returned by both
  methods when the log has no retained entries.
- `read` is async (io_uring positioned reads via `EntryReader`) and the visitor
  is also async, allowing it to perform I/O (e.g., sending messages) between
  entry reads.
- No `direction` parameter — the client computes the appropriate `from_seq`
  using `first_seq`/`last_seq` from the `CHAN_SEQ` response. The log always
  reads forward.

### LogVisitor Pattern

```rust
pub struct LogEntry<'a> {
    pub seq: u64,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub from: &'a [u8],
    pub payload: &'a [u8],
}

#[async_trait(?Send)]
pub trait LogVisitor {
    async fn visit(&mut self, entry: LogEntry<'_>) -> anyhow::Result<()>;
}
```

The visitor borrows entry data directly from the `EntryReader`'s pre-allocated
buffers — **zero heap allocations** on the read hot path. The `async` signature
allows visitors to perform async work (e.g., sending messages over the network)
without blocking.

The concrete `HistoryVisitor` used by `ChannelShard::history()` holds references
to the transmitter, channel name, `history_id`, and the payload pool:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    HistoryVisitor                          │
│                                                            │
│  For each LogEntry:                                        │
│    1. Construct Message::Message { history_id, ... }       │
│    2. Copy payload into PoolBuffer (no heap alloc)         │
│    3. Call transmitter.send_message_with_payload()         │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### MessageLogFactory

```rust
#[async_trait(?Send)]
pub trait MessageLogFactory: Clone + Send + Sync + 'static {
    type Log: MessageLog;
    async fn create(&self, handler: &StringAtom) -> Self::Log;
}
```

The factory holds `base_dir` and `max_payload_size` at construction time.
`create()` is async because it performs recovery (scanning segment files,
validating CRC checksums, rebuilding indexes) using `compio::fs` I/O. It
derives the channel directory using the shared SHA-256 path utility (same as
`FileChannelStore`).

## Write Path

### Append

```
append(message, payload, max_messages)
│
├─ 1. Serialize entry: seq | timestamp | from_len | payload_len | from | payload | crc32
├─ 2. write_all_at(entry, seg.file_size) via io_uring (compio positioned write)
├─ 3. If this is the first entry in the segment, OR `bytes_since_index >= 4096`
│     → write an index entry into the .idx mmap pointing at the *current*
│     entry's offset (the offset before this append's write extends the file),
│     then reset `bytes_since_index` to 0
├─ 4. Update in-memory state (bytes_since_index, last_seq, segment byte count)
├─ 5. If segment exceeds 128 MiB → roll to new segment (see Segment Roll)
└─ 6. If (last_seq - first_seq + 1) > max_messages → evict oldest segment(s)
```

Writes use **positioned I/O** via `compio::fs::File::write_all_at()` (io_uring
`WRITE` op). There is no append mode in compio — the file offset is tracked
in-memory as `seg.file_size` and passed explicitly to each write. This is safe
under the single-threaded shard actor model. Data is visible to subsequent reads
immediately (even before fsync) because both reads and writes operate on the
same file through the kernel page cache.

### Flush

`flush()` calls async `sync_all().await` on both active files:

- the active segment's `.log` file
- the active segment's `.idx` file (whose dirty pages come from `MmapMut` writes)

Both syncs run through compio/io_uring and avoid synchronous `mmap.flush()`
inside async shard code.

**Durability guarantee:** same as Kafka — data survives process crashes (data is
in the kernel page cache) but not power loss without fsync. The existing flush
mechanism (immediate when `message_flush_interval=0`, or periodic via background
task) is unchanged.

**Linux dependency.** Skipping `mmap.flush()` (i.e. `msync`) and relying on
`sync_all()` of the underlying file handle to flush pages dirtied through
`MmapMut` is correct on Linux because file-backed mmaps share the unified
page cache with regular file I/O — `fsync(2)` flushes all dirty pages backing
the file regardless of how they were dirtied. POSIX does not guarantee this
in general; the design assumes the io_uring/Linux runtime environment
already required by the rest of the project.

### Segment Roll

Checked **after** each append:

```
After write completes:
│
├─ Active segment > 128 MiB?
│   ├─ No  → done
│   └─ Yes → roll:
│       1. Close active .log file handle
│       2. sync_all() active .idx file
│       3. Drop active .idx MmapMut
│       4. Truncate .idx from pre-allocated size to actual written size
│       5. Re-open .idx as read-only Mmap (now a sealed segment)
│       6. Create new .log file (named after next seq to be written)
│       7. Pre-allocate new .idx to max capacity and MmapMut it
│       8. New segment becomes the active segment
```

## Read Path

### Index Lookup

To read from `from_seq`:

```
1. Binary search the in-memory segment list for the last segment
   whose first_seq <= from_seq

2. Binary search the segment's .idx for the largest
   relative_seq <= (from_seq - segment_base_seq)

3. Start positioned reads at the offset from the index entry

4. Scan forward entry-by-entry until seq >= from_seq

5. Begin visiting entries until limit is reached
   or the segment ends (then continue to next segment)
```

### EntryReader — Zero-Allocation Positioned Reads

Instead of chunk-based buffered reading, the implementation uses an `EntryReader`
struct that performs **two positioned reads per entry** via `compio::fs::File`
(io_uring). Pre-allocated buffers eliminate per-entry heap allocation.

```rust
struct EntryReader {
    header: Vec<u8>,    // always ENTRY_HEADER_SIZE (22 bytes)
    body: Vec<u8>,      // pre-allocated to NID_MAX_LENGTH + max_payload_size + CRC_SIZE
    seq: u64,
    timestamp: u64,
    from_len: usize,
    payload_len: usize,
    entry_size: u64,
}
```

| Property     | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Header buffer | 22 bytes (fixed) |
| Body buffer | `NID_MAX_LENGTH` (510) + `max_payload_size` + 4 bytes |
| Lifetime    | Created once at construction, reused across all operations (reads, recovery, index rebuilds) |
| Guarantee   | Always fits any valid entry's body (from + payload + CRC) at the *current* `max_payload_size` |

**`max_payload_size` stability requirement.** The body buffer is sized at
construction time using the configured `max_payload_size`. The append path
rejects oversized entries before writing, so a single run cannot produce
unreadable segments. However, **shrinking `max_payload_size` between
restarts is not supported**: pre-existing segments may contain entries
larger than the new buffer capacity, and the read-side check rejects them
as malformed (the segment's read terminates early, mirroring the
"subtle index corruption" failure mode in [Recovery](#recovery)). Operators
must only increase `max_payload_size`, or drain/delete affected channels
before reducing it.

`NID_MAX_LENGTH` (510 bytes) is derived from the protocol's maximum NID size:
`USERNAME_MAX_LENGTH` (256) + 1 (`@`) + `DOMAIN_MAX_LENGTH` (253).

**Read loop:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  For each entry at position `pos`:                           │
│                                                              │
│  1. read_exact_at(header, pos)          ← ENTRY_HEADER_SIZE  │
│     Parse seq, timestamp, from_len, payload_len              │
│                                                              │
│  2. read_exact_at(body[..body_size], pos + ENTRY_HEADER_SIZE)│
│     Uses IoBuf::slice(..body_size) to read exactly           │

│     capacity                                                 │
│                                                              │
│  3. Verify CRC32 over header + from + payload, comparing     │
│     against the trailing 4 bytes of the body buffer          │
│                                                              │
│  4. If seq >= from_seq:                                      │
│     visitor.visit(LogEntry { seq, from, payload }).await     │
│     (from and payload borrow directly from body buffer)      │
│                                                              │
│  5. Advance pos += entry_size                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Buffers are moved into compio via `std::mem::take()` for each I/O op and
reclaimed from `BufResult` — the standard compio buffer-ownership pattern.

### Visitor Invocation

The visitor's `visit()` method is called between positioned reads. The
`LogEntry` borrows `from` and `payload` directly from the `EntryReader`'s body
buffer. The same `EntryReader` is reused for recovery scanning
(`scan_and_validate`, `rebuild_index`).

## Eviction

Eviction is **count-based**, driven by `max_persist_messages`.

```
After each append:
│
├─ If max_persist_messages == 0 → skip eviction (no retention limit)
├─ Compute logical first_seq = last_seq - max_persist_messages + 1
├─ For each sealed segment (oldest first; the active segment is never evicted):
│   └─ Is segment's last_seq < logical first_seq?
│       ├─ Yes → delete .log + .idx, update in-memory segment list
│       └─ No  → stop (all remaining segments have retained messages)
```

A segment is deleted only when **every** message in it falls outside the
retention window. This means actual disk usage may slightly exceed
`max_persist_messages` worth of data (by up to one segment's worth of extra
messages), but the trade-off is clean O(1) eviction with no rewriting.

**Active-segment invariant:** the active (last) segment is **never** evicted,
even if all of its entries fall outside the retention window — there must
always be a segment to append into. The worst-case on-disk overhead per
channel is therefore approximately one segment's worth of data: about
`SEGMENT_MAX_BYTES` (128 MiB) above `max_persist_messages * avg_entry_size`,
plus the active `.idx` file's pre-allocated capacity (~384 KB by default) and
up to one extra entry, since segment rollover only fires after an append
pushes the `.log` file past `SEGMENT_MAX_BYTES`. This is most visible when
`max_persist_messages` is small relative to `SEGMENT_MAX_BYTES / avg_entry_size`,
or under bursty traffic where a single segment fills before
`max_persist_messages` worth of newer messages arrive. Operators sizing disk
should plan accordingly.

A `max_persist_messages` of `0` is interpreted as **no eviction** — the log
grows unbounded. This is the de facto behavior of `MessageLog::append` when
called with `max_messages == 0`.

## Recovery

On startup, the message log restores its state from disk. Recovery is **fully
async** — all file I/O uses `compio::fs` (io_uring), except for `read_dir`
(no compio equivalent, uses `std::fs`).

An `EntryReader` and an index rebuild buffer (`Vec<u8>`) are created once at the
start of recovery and reused across all segments to avoid per-segment allocation.

```
1. List *.log files in channel directory, sorted by first_seq (from filename)
   (std::fs::read_dir — no compio equivalent)

2. For each sealed segment (all except the last):
   ├─ Zero-byte .log → delete .log + .idx and skip to the next segment.
   ├─ Scan .log end-to-end with EntryReader (CRC validation) to determine
   │   `(last_seq, valid_size)`. This is a full-segment linear scan —
   │   recovery cost is therefore O(total sealed bytes) per channel. The
   │   `.idx`'s last entry could be used to bound the scan, but the current
   │   implementation does not exploit this. Segments with zero valid
   │   entries are deleted.
   │   If `valid_size < file_size` (CRC failed mid-segment, i.e. bit rot
   │   or other on-disk corruption past the first entry), increment the
   │   `message_log_sealed_segment_truncations_total` counter and emit a
   │   `tracing::warn!` carrying the path, file size, valid size and last
   │   valid seq. The segment is registered with `file_size = valid_size`
   │   so subsequent reads stop at the last validated entry; entries past
   │   the corruption boundary remain on disk but are unreachable. This
   │   surfaces silent data loss to operators rather than letting it be
   │   discovered later via missing history.
   ├─ .idx looks valid? → memory-map read-only (Mmap)
   └─ .idx missing or visibly corrupt? → rebuild by scanning .log with
   │                   EntryReader, then atomically replace the `.idx`:
   │                   write to a `<first_seq>.tmp` sibling, `sync_all`
   │                   the temp file, close it, and rename it onto
   │                   `<first_seq>.idx`. After a successful rename, the
   │                   parent directory is `sync_all`'d on a best-effort
   │                   basis so the rename itself is durable across a
   │                   crash; if that fsync fails the `.idx` content is
   │                   still fully written, the next recovery just
   │                   re-validates it. On any failure before the rename
   │                   succeeds (including failure to open the `.log`,
   │                   read its metadata, or create the temp file) both
   │                   the temp (if any) and the existing `.idx` are
   │                   removed so the read path falls back to a
   │                   full-segment scan instead of trusting a partial
   │                   or stale index. Mid-rebuild crashes leave either
   │                   the previous `.idx` intact or the new one in
   │                   place, never a half-written file.

   "Visibly corrupt" means any of: file size falls outside `(0, idx_capacity]`,
   file size is not a multiple of INDEX_ENTRY_SIZE, the first entry is not
   `(relative_seq=0, offset=0)` (entry-0 rule), `relative_seq` or `offset` is
   not strictly monotonically increasing across consecutive entries, or the
   last entry's offset does not leave room for a full entry header in the
   `.log` file (i.e. `offset + ENTRY_HEADER_SIZE > log_file_size`). Subtle
   corruption (e.g. a wrong middle-entry offset that lies inside the .log
   while still preserving monotonicity) is not detected by these checks. A
   bad but in-range offset can cause an indexed read to start at the wrong
   position, where `EntryReader` rejects the malformed bytes via CRC32 and
   the segment's read terminates early — valid later entries in that segment
   are silently skipped for the affected read. CRC32 prevents returning
   malformed entries, but completeness is not guaranteed; the recovery path
   is to delete the `.idx` so it gets rebuilt on next startup.

3. For the active (last) segment:
   ├─ Zero-byte .log → delete .log + .idx; mark the active slot as
   │   unrecovered (see step 4) and skip the rest of step 3.
   ├─ Scan forward with EntryReader, validating CRC32 per entry
   ├─ Truncate at the first invalid/partial entry (file.set_len().await)
   ├─ If the scan yielded zero valid entries → delete `.log` + `.idx` and
   │   mark the active slot as unrecovered (see step 4). The next `append()`
   │   falls through `Inner::create_segment` and creates a fresh segment
   │   named after that entry's seq. Sealed segments are unaffected.
   ├─ Otherwise:
   │   ├─ Rebuild .idx from valid entries (reusing index buffer)
   │   ├─ Compute bytes_since_index: read the last index entry to find its offset,
   │   │   scan forward from there to count bytes written after it, so the index
   │   │   interval resumes correctly on the next append

4. Open the active segment for appending **only if** step 3 actually recovered
   a non-empty active segment (`active_segment_recovered = true`). When step 3
   discarded the last segment (zero-byte or zero valid entries), we must NOT
   promote the preceding sealed segment to active — that would open a sealed
   `.log` for writes and double-map its `.idx` (read-only + writable) to the
   same file. In that case `active_log` stays `None` and the next `append()`
   creates a fresh active segment via `Inner::create_segment`. When recovery
   does proceed:
   ├─ Open .log for writes (positioned I/O at seg.file_size)
   ├─ Extend .idx to pre-allocated capacity
   └─ Memory-map read-write (MmapMut), set write_pos to actual index size

   Failures in this step are **fatal** for the channel (bubbled to the
   caller): a half-recovered active segment that cannot accept index updates
   would silently corrupt subsequent reads.

5. Derive in-memory state:
   ├─ last_seq  → from last valid entry of newest segment
   ├─ first_seq → from oldest segment's filename
   └─ Per-segment metadata (first_seq, last_seq, file_size)
```

**Guarantees:**
- A crash mid-append loses at most the in-progress entry (CRC detects the partial write).
- A crash during segment roll leaves at most an empty segment file, which is cleaned up.
- Visibly corrupt sealed indexes (per the checks in step 2) are rebuilt from the log on recovery. Subtle index corruption that passes those structural checks is not detected: a bad but in-range offset can cause an indexed read to start at the wrong position, where CRC32 validation prevents returning malformed entries but valid later entries in that segment may be silently skipped for the affected read. Recovering from this state requires deleting the `.idx` so it gets rebuilt on next startup.

## Constants

| Constant                | Value     | Description |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `SEGMENT_MAX_BYTES`    | 128 MiB   | Maximum segment file size before rolling |
| `INDEX_INTERVAL_BYTES` | 4096      | Bytes of log data between sparse index entries |
| `INDEX_ENTRY_SIZE`     | 12 bytes  | Size of one index entry (`relative_seq` + `offset`) |
| `ENTRY_HEADER_SIZE`    | 22 bytes  | Fixed header: seq(8) + timestamp(8) + from_len(2) + payload_len(4) |
| `CRC_SIZE`             | 4 bytes   | CRC32 checksum appended to each entry |
| `NID_MAX_LENGTH`       | 510 bytes | Maximum NID size: USERNAME_MAX_LENGTH(256) + 1 + DOMAIN_MAX_LENGTH(253) |

All constants are hardcoded. They can be promoted to per-channel configuration
if a real need arises.

## Dependencies

| Crate       | Version | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| `compio`    | 0.18    | Async file I/O via io_uring (`compio::fs::File` for positioned reads/writes) |
| `memmap2`   | 0.9     | Memory-mapped index files (`Mmap` for sealed, `MmapMut` for active) |
| `crc32fast` | 1       | CRC32 checksums for log entry integrity |

## Concurrency Model

The message log operates in a **single-threaded** context. Each channel is
owned by a shard actor, and the shard processes commands sequentially. There is
no concurrent read/write access to a channel's message log.

- No locks, no atomics.
- `Rc<MessageLog>` (not `Arc`) — consistent with the existing `Channel` struct.
- Interior mutability via `RefCell` — provides runtime borrow checking that
  catches violations in debug builds. The `MessageLog` trait exposes `&self`
  methods; `FileMessageLog` uses `RefCell<Inner>` to mutate internal state.
- `read()` and `append()` are never called concurrently for the same channel.

## Testing

Integration tests live in `crates/server/tests/c2s_channel_persistence.rs`.

**Test categories:**

| Category | What it verifies |
|----------|-----------------|
| Append + read | Single entry, multiple entries, round-trip correctness |
| Sparse index | Binary search finds the correct offset |
| Segment roll | Cross-segment reads return continuous data |
| Eviction | Segment deletion when all messages fall outside retention |
| Seq tracking | `first_seq` / `last_seq` correctness through append and eviction |
| CRC validation | Corrupt entries detected, partial writes rejected |
| Recovery | Truncation at corrupt tail, index rebuild from log |
| Edge cases | Empty log, `from_seq` beyond `last_seq`, single-entry segments |

Tests use `tempfile::TempDir` for isolated file system state.

Existing tests using `NoopMessageLog` remain unchanged — they verify channel
manager logic independently of persistence.

## File Locations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `crates/server/src/channel/file_message_log.rs` | `FileMessageLog` implementation |
| `crates/server/src/channel/store.rs` | `MessageLog` and `MessageLogFactory` trait definitions |
| `crates/server/src/channel/file_store.rs` | `FileChannelStore` (shares path utility) |
| `crates/server/src/channel/manager.rs` | `ChannelShard::history()` and `channel_seq()` integration |
| `crates/server/tests/c2s_channel_persistence.rs` | Integration tests |
